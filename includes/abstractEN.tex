This thesis' focus is on designing and implementing a solution that automatically generates an application programming interface in process-oriented systems based on the Petriflow modeling language. 
In the first part of the thesis we introduce the topic of modelling processes using extended Petri nets. Next part is focused on designing a cloud solution, that is able to automatically generate a robust and performant web application programming interface. Next chapter of this thesis shows the implementation process of the designed solution using Spring Cloud framework and Kotlin programming language and analyses the security of the implemented system. 
The final part shows the automatic and manual testing done on the system and summarizes the thesis' findings.
